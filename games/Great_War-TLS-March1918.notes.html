					  <br>Big Bertha's, Tanks, Advanced Tanks, SuperDreadnaughts and both Gas Engineers can only be placed 1 of each type per factory per turn.
					  <br>The territory must be owned at the start of your turn to be able to place.
					  <br>Example: You can place a tank and Big Bertha in the same territory in the same turn but not 2 tanks, if the factory is owned at start of turn.
					  <br>
					  <br>You cannot place a special unit type if there is one of the same unit type currently in the same territory.
					  <br>This does not apply to the Bolshevik tanks.
					  <br>Unplaced units live.
					  <br><h2>Map Information</h2>
					  <br>
						  This map is based on a unique projection developed specifically for the Great War variant 
						  and is designed to take full advantage of the map scaling feature in TripleA.  
					  <br>The desire to highlight the Western Front, while still giving the game a truly world-wide scope, 
						  required that some abstractions were made to the map.
					  <br>These include several game boxes/inserts which connect to the major areas of conflict 
						  around Europe, Africa and the Middle East. 
					  <br> * Cairo and Istanbul are canals.
					  <br>Yes, the multinational force in Arkhangelsk is supposed to be there...ect.

					  I mostly updated the game to the current 1.7.0.3 engine standards while also converting it to the newer GW 4.3 map base.
					<br>Due to the new map base there have been some pu and unit changes. 
					<br>Ones worthy of mention are:
					  <br>
					<br> PU changes:
					<br>Germany is +1 now due to Lithuania/Belurus/Livonia
  <br>Bolsheviks +1 due to Moscow
  <br>WhiteRussians +1 due to Kygyz
  <br>Austrians the starting PU looks the same but Romania is handled different and it's really + 1 due to Carpathia
  <br>Ottomans +1 due to the sz 62 convoy zone 
  <br>Italians +1 due to the sz 55 convoy zone
    <br>
      <br>
  Unit changes:
    <br>Germany, White Russians and the Bolsheviks have 1 more infantry each in the Eastern Front.
      <br>
	<br>
  I think this balances out the change with the new map base and makes the eastern front slightly more dynamic while encouraging action in the med too.
    <br>
      <br>
  There was some unit art changes and I also adjusted unit values to match Lebowski's notes. Cossacks now blitz, support, ect.
